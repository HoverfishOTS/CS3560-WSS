2025-05-01 18:27:21,248 INFO: Decision: REST | Reason: The player has already moved to the current position from the starting point, and they have not used any resources yet. Since the player's ENERGY is currently at maximum (15), resting would consume some FOOD and WATER, but it would also regain +2 ENERGY, which is a good way to maintain the player's resources while preparing for future moves.

2025-05-01 18:27:26,136 INFO: Decision: MOVE NORTHWEST | Reason: The player is currently at position (0, 0) and needs to move east to escape. Moving northwest allows the player to move away from the Desert terrain to their north, while also getting closer to the Plains terrain, which is considered safe and beneficial for travel. This move also sets up the player for a potential future move east, while also considering their current resource levels.

This move does not risk any resource going to 0, and it allows the player to potentially explore other tiles and resources nearby.

2025-05-01 18:27:38,808 INFO: Decision: REST | Reason: The player's energy is at a relatively high level (15), and resting would restore 2 energy without wasting too much food and water. This action also gives the player a chance to reassess their current situation and plan their next move while avoiding a potentially costly or high-risk movement.

RESTING will give the player +2 ENERGY, which is necessary to make a move that won't risk running out of ENERGY.

It is better to wait and rest when the player's ENERGY level drops below 15, allowing the player to regain +2 ENERGY without wasting resources.

Moving east allows the player to progress towards the goal, and the available options at the current position show a Plains tile with a low movement cost (-2) and a small food and water cost (-1 each). This move is safe and makes progress, making it a suitable choice.
