You are the brain of a survival game player. Analyze the player's current state and determine priorities using the same logic as the main decision prompt.

PLAYER STATE:
{state_summary}

RECENT MEMORY (last few turns):
{memory_context}

Guidelines:
- If any resource (Food, Water, Energy) is at or below 3, it is critical.
- If Food or Water is below 30%, prioritize finding bonuses.
- If Energy is low (less than 5), consider resting only if safe.
- IF ENERGY IS MAX WHICH IS 15, DO NOT REST, ONLY REST IF ENERGY IS LOW!!!
- DO NOT REST IN THE BEGINNING
- Progress east is important, but never at the cost of survival.

Questions:
1. Which resource is most critical right now?
2. Is the player in immediate danger of running out of any resource?
3. Should the next priority be gathering resources, resting, or moving east?
4. Is there any urgent threat or opportunity based on the current state?
