This move also sets up the player for a potential future move east, while also considering their current resource levels.

Prioritizing eastward progress on safe, resource-boosting Plains tiles aligns with the goal of reaching x ≥ 10 while maintaining survival. Resting would waste time without advancing progress, and trading is unnecessary with current resource levels.
